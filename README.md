# Personal-Projects
Ideas I've come up with and implemented(or am currently implementing).
Or it may also include programs that are not my original idea(like the Sieve
of Eratosthenes), but all the programs here are made by me, for me, and not
as the suggestion nor under the instruction of someone else.


I'll be bringing in old projects(starting March 10th 2018), 
which will thus not have any commit history behind them
