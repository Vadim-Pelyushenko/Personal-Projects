For now, there is just a class here that will check if an inputted String is balanced or not for
the following parentheses: (), [], {}, <>

However, I'm considering making a program that could check if a java program is valid or not.
As well for HTML code, but I should generalize determining whether opening and closing "markers"
and validly placed. (I.E. <html> </html> are corresponding opening and closing markers).
