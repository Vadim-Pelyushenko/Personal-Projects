\title{A Generalized Algorithm for producing Integer Power Reduction Formulas
of Cosine}

\maketitle
\noindent \textbf{The idea behind this algorithm was inspired by a video 
entitled \textit{cos(1) + ... + cos(n)} by Peyam R. Tabrizian}

\textbf{Prior to seeing this video, I understood that complex numbers stemmed from
the idea that $\sqrt{-1} = i$, and that complex numbers had some properties and
could be dealt with in particular ways, but I did not believe they had any utility.}
\\
\\
\textbf{After watching the video however, I became a believer. So I present a way
a way I've discovered, for generating the integer power reduction formulas for cosine which hinges on the imaginary representation of cosine.}
