This program will create a series of System.out.print(); and System.out.println(); statements,
where it will print out some number of characters from "ABCD...abcd...", randomly selecting
which ones will be print, and which ones will be println's.

I made this program so that I could provide it to a student I'm tutoring, but can be
reused in the future for anyone else I'm tutoring.
It also makes use of the RandomPermutations algorithms that I have made :)

The program is executed within a command line(and communicates to the user through the command line)
A sample execution of the program (> indicates user input):
This program will generate a random series of prinout statements,
which may either be print, or println

How many println's would you like to generate? > 3
How many total letters would you like to generate? > 7
System.out.print("A");
System.out.println("B");
System.out.print("C");
System.out.print("D");
System.out.print("E");
System.out.println("F");
System.out.println("G");

What do you predict the output of this program will be?(Type in your answer on notepad or something)
When you are ready to check, type in 'T'
> T
The printout of the program would be:
----------------------------------------------------
AB
CDEF
G
----------------------------------------------------
Did you get it right?
